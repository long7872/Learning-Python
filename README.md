# Learning Python Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning Python --- from
fundamental concepts to data analysis and introductory machine learning.

Instead of being a single product, this repository is a structured
learning space where I practice coding, solve exercises, explore
libraries, and build a solid programming foundation.

## Purpose

-   Strengthen core Python fundamentals
-   Practice problem-solving and logical thinking
-   Learn data manipulation and visualization
-   Explore machine learning basics
-   Build a strong foundation for future AI and Data projects

## What I'm Learning

### Python Fundamentals

-   Variables and data types
-   Conditionals (if/else)
-   Loops (for, while)
-   Functions
-   String manipulation
-   Basic input/output
-   Even/odd checking
-   Comparing string lengths

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-   Classes and Objects
-   Constructors
-   Inheritance
-   Encapsulation
-   Method overriding

### Working with External Libraries

-   Using requests to call APIs
-   Web scraping with BeautifulSoup (bs4)
-   Installing and managing packages with pip

### NumPy

-   Creating arrays and matrices
-   Indexing and slicing
-   Mathematical operations
-   Vectorized computation

### Pandas

-   Series and DataFrames
-   Data cleaning
-   Filtering and grouping
-   Solving 100+ Pandas exercises
-   Real-world style data processing

### Data Visualization

-   Basic plotting with matplotlib
-   Visualizing trends and distributions

### Introduction to Machine Learning

-   Basic ML concepts
-   Train/test split
-   Using Scikit-learn models
-   Understanding workflow (fit → predict → evaluate)

## Tech Stack

-   Python 3.x
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib
-   Scikit-learn
-   Requests
-   BeautifulSoup (bs4)
-   Jupyter Notebook
-   VS Code

## How to Use

### Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn requests beautifulsoup4 jupyter
```
Run Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Option 2: Using VS Code

1.  Install Python extension
2.  Open the repository folder
3.  Run .py files or .ipynb notebooks directly

## Learning Progress

This repository is continuously updated as I learn new concepts and
improve my understanding of Python and data analysis.

## Future Learning Plans

-   Advanced data structures
-   Algorithm practice
-   API-based mini projects
-   Data preprocessing pipelines
-   Machine Learning mini projects
-   NLP fundamentals
